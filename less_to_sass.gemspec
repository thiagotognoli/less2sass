      Less2Sass is an easy to use converter between Less and
      Sass, respectively SCSS, dynamic stylesheet formats.
      It is based on abstract syntax tree transformation
      instead of the common string replacement methods
      using regular expressions. It does not support a lot
      of language features, yet. However, when finished,
      it will offer the developers an easy way to convert
      between these formats without the following manual
      conversion as it is today.
